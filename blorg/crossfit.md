title: CrossFit Around the World
---

Whenever I travel (usually for work) I try to find a CrossFit box where I can drop in for a workout.
I really appreciate, particularly in foreign countries, getting to do something that is so familiar and yet a surprise.
It's also great to spend an hour *not* talking about my day job.
I will say, the "cult" of CrossFit is very strong, and walking in for a class is pretty much the same everywhere I've been.
