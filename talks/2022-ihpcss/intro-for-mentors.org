* Mentoring at the Summer School
** Committee
- Scott Callaghan (lead)
- Weronkia Filinger
- Elsa Gonsiorowski
- Ilya Zhukov

** Mentoring Program
- Students consistently rate the mentoring program as the most valuable and distinctive part of the summer school
- We have a number of sessions planned throughout the week, please participate!
- You have something to offer every student
- Matching is a best guess based on the surveys
  - Not just matched on technical topics
  - If not a good match, that's ok; students can request a change
  - Students will have the opportunity to talk with all the staff

* What is Mentoring?
** Mentoring Basics
- Partnership between 2 people
- Give support, guidance, maybe advice
  - Listen, understand, validate
  - Favor guiding over telling
- Based on mutual trust and respect
- Ask questions and challenge, but be encouraging

** Topics for Mentoring
- Not just technical topics
- Students are interested in hearing about:
  - Career progression
  - Work-life balance
  - Dealing with tough advisors
  - Future of HPC
- You may need to bring up these topics
- Ultimately, these conversations can have the most influence on their career paths

* Mentoring at the Summer School
** Mentoring Groups
** Mentoring Schedule

* Final Words
** Impostor Syndrome
- Students feel like frauds and like they don't deserve to be here, or in research in general
- Doesn't matter what others tell them: success dismissed as luck, timing, not real, or deception
- May look like lacking ambition or claiming lack of expertise
- Ways to help:
  - Share that these thoughts of common and don't mean students don't belong
    - 70% of academics at some point; 40% of academics right now
  - Help students become more aware of thought patterns: feeling like a failure does not make it true
  - Ask students what they would tell someone in their position
  - Some of you have personal experience with impostor syndrome -- your perspective is powerful
** Ask for Help
- It can be really powerful to tell your mentee that you don't have all the answers
- Use your network (everyone here) to help your mentee with things you don't know how to address
- Please don't hesitate to reach out to the mentoring committee, in person, on slack, or over email
