### FALSE

**Networking Establishes your Brand**

- I know who she is, I know what she does or what she's good at
- sources for new ideas, collaborations, recommendations, internships, job interviews, program committees, invites to talks
- think about what you give. grad students -> undergrads
- think about who you can mentor, not just what you can get out of it
- Horizontal vs. Vertical Networking

**Networking is a skill**

- elevator speech
- set goals to get yourself to network
- talk to those around you
- prepare for an event
	- offer to help
- introvert or extrovert?
- face-to-face or online
- follow through
	- business cards! follow through notes

Everyone can have a conversation with other people... but what is the point? How is networking different from having a converstation?

- How can I help you?
- Set a goal for the social activity... three new people
- Elevator speech as an ice breaker (talk about yourself)

Increase networking effectivness by writing down next steps

- name
- where are you from
- what are you doing

**Networking is a Relationship**

- keep in touch
- write down next steps

**Why bother?**

- There will be a day when you know two people who need to get connected
- some day you will need people to help you
- run a conference maybe?

**Lessons from their experience**

- force yourself to get out of your comfort zone and approach people
- open source is a great way to network
	- developer
	- tester
	- power user
	- UI person
- regional meetups (systers)
- conferences, local talks (give a talk!)
