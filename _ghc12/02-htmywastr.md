	- consistent

**It's all about ME!**

- what *you* did in a project
- *your* individual contribution
- problem that was solved
- value added
- positive result
- what you learned
- *tie efforts into bigger picture and overall value-added*

> avoid detailed task lists!!!

### Personal Brand

How do you want employers to see you? What kind of person are you? Where do you want employers to put you?
Have a 3rd party read your resume and summarize what they took away

> cover letters are dead (apparently)

Add links!

**Q: What if you haven't done that much, (don't have experience or aren't exactly qualified)?**
- Mark where you had potential and list your strengths & learning opportunities you used

**Q: Add school projects?**
- totally!

> What will light you up (to bring up in an interview)? what are your passions, what excites you?
