1. it is all in your attitude

	- career path = career obstacle course
	- things are happening FOR me (not to me)
2. You need feel comfortable with being uncomfortable
	- you may be out of place, but stick it out
	- comfort OR growth, can't do both at the same time
3. Act as if ______.
	- for what ever you need to do
	- courage is being able to act even when you are scared, not that you aren't scared

	> "Act your way into a new way of thinking, not think your way into a new way of acting." Stay out of your head!
4. Control your career PR agent: it's you!!
	- every time you open your mouth it is a press release
	- be careful and deliberate, say "Thank you" – and stop!

	> "Frying bacon when you're naked. You know it's going to hurt, just not where."
	> "Always tell the truth, just not so much of it."
5. it takes a village
	- don't be in your career alone both inside and outside of work
	- have a network
		- what you know
		- who you know
		- ***who knows what you know***
