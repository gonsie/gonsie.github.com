[GitHub.com](http://github.com) has become *the* place for sharing code and hosting open source software projects.
Employers have started asking for GitHub usernames when recruiting new employees.

Like any social platform, you can *follow* your favorite users and *star* your favorite repositories.

### Try Git

If you want to get some more experience with git, use GitHub's interactive [Try Git](http://try.github.io) demo.

### Pages

[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) are an easy way to create and host a website.
GitHub lets you create a website for each user and repository.

GitHub supports <mark>static sites</mark> generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
Static sites (as opposed to dynamic sites) are usually simple, text-based websites that do not require databases or other advanced/backend features.
