A few weeks into the new year and it's time once again to re-start my blog.
Looking back at my [2018 Review](https://www.gonsie.com/blorg/2018-review.html), I had vowed to publish at least one blog post per month.
I didn't quite succeed, but I certainly learned some things along the way.

## What Went Right

Vowing to publish one post per month was a success, even though I didn't actually achieve it.
I wrote one post January through September (though technically I had 2 posts in August).
Most months it pushed me to write more, though sometimes I found myself "saving" a post until the next month.

I know that regularly posting is also something that is typically recommended for those who are trying to gaining readers/increase their audience.
This year I received a few emails from the people Emacs community who had feedback on what I wrote&#x2013;very exciting!


## What Went Wrong

I knew that the last few months of the year would be the hardest; I always struggle with personal goals October through December.
Missing a month also became a huge block to posting again.
This compounded with a downside of "at least one post per month" in that I ended up publishing *only* one post each month.

By spacing my posts out monthly, I felt like I had to have a decent amount of content.
Indeed, that's pretty much how I've been blogging thus far: long, well thought out content, less along the lines of "status updates" or micro-blogging.
Meaning, I often felt like I didn't have enough to say to warrant a post.
It also meant that the blog posts were more technical, less personal.
Figuring out how much I want reveal about myself on this blog is an on-going struggle.


## Looking Forward

I want to keep the one post per month rule, but set myself up for success later in the year.
I'll start by drafting a few posts that I can keep around and publish in November and December.

I would like to branch out from Emacs and Org-mode, but I honestly have so much fun with these!
Emacs is also an easy topic which isn't too personal or something that my work could possibly care about.
I should also get around to some meta posts: why I encourage everyone to blog, how to build a personal site, my personal blog doctrine, etc.

I'd also like to add some more status-update like posts.
I'm not sure the exact form these might take&#x2026; I think keeping them out of my main blog index (but putting them in the RSS feed) might work?
Or I could try to make use of twitter.
Other blogs that I follow make use of 'micro-posts', title-only (title-less?) posts that appear visually different in the index.
