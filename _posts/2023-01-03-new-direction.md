With the new year, I've been re-thinking my hobbies.
I haven't done a major re-assessment in a while, and it's pretty obvious that my interest in regular blog updates has waned.
On the one hand, I have a ton of half-done blog posts and half-started emacs side projects.
I wish I just had a good way to share them, but posting half-finished drafts just seems&#x2026; shoddy.


## Abandoned Posts

Just for the hell of it, here are the half-done blog posts I have hanging around.
Let me know if any one in particular sounds interesting to you.
Comments on this and all posts go directly to me (and for the time being I have no actual system for publishing them).

-   Creating a 2 column layout with [emacs-dashboard](https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard)
-   Alternate time systems
-   Getting into emacs ansi-term
-   Ediff is freaking amazing
-   How I debug emacs issues
-   Making org-mode presentations beautiful (presenting from within emacs)


## New Interests

Anyways, here is a list of some hobbies that are sparking my interest right now.

-   Reading books that really capture my attention
-   Knitting (if only I had the time/space, but alas, not in this current season of life)
-   Trying out modal editing, maybe something like [Meow](https://github.com/meow-edit/meow)
-   Trying a new keyboard and/or layout (I've been using Dvorak and Apple keyboards for a like decade ?!?)
-   Converting this website to a new tech stack
