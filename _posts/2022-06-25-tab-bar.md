Emacs 27.1 introduced a tab bar and I finally got around to trying it out.
I found it particularly useful for switching between a few buffers quickly, particularly because I have muscle memory for the Safari tab keybindings (which I set for Emacs tabs).

I must say, the implementation is really nice.
Ultimately customizable (a la everything Emacs).
It also has some nice interactions with the mouse (if that's your jam).
You can use drag-and-drop to change tab ordering!


## Basic Key Bindings

This was the first thing I setup, especially since I knew exactly what I wanted.
These mirror Safari's tab keybindings.

{% highlight elisp %}
(global-set-key (kbd "s-{") 'tab-bar-switch-to-prev-tab)
(global-set-key (kbd "s-}") 'tab-bar-switch-to-next-tab)
(global-set-key (kbd "s-t") 'tab-bar-new-tab)
(global-set-key (kbd "s-w") 'tab-bar-close-tab)
{% endhighlight %}

The `s-` prefix key is the "command ⌘" key on a Mac.

I think `s-w` is set to `kill-emacs` or `delete-frame` something similar by default.
I personally never want that to happen so I've had those functions and keybinding disabled for years now.
I also had `s-{` and `s-}` bound to switch between frames (`other-frame`), but I usually use the Emacs GUI in full screen mode, so using these for tabs makes more sense.
At least for right now.


## Settings

Of course, the tab bar comes with a bunch of customizable settings.
I'm using:

{% highlight elisp %}
(when (< 26 emacs-major-version)
 (tab-bar-mode 1)                           ;; enable tab bar
 (setq tab-bar-show 1)                      ;; hide bar if <= 1 tabs open
 (setq tab-bar-close-button-show nil)       ;; hide tab close / X button
 (setq tab-bar-new-tab-choice "*dashboard*");; buffer to show in new tabs
 (setq tab-bar-tab-hints t)                 ;; show tab numbers
  (setq tab-bar-format '(tab-bar-format-tabs tab-bar-separator)))
                                            ;; elements to include in bar
{% endhighlight %}

The `when` clause wrapping these settings ensures my configuration is maximally compatible with [all modern Emacs versions](./emacs-v22.html).
I figured out these settings through a combination of looking at the `*Customize*` menu for Tab Bar and reading the help documentation for each variable.

One setting I really like (but am not using right now), is the ability to have a "Menu" button in the tab bar.
This is achieved by adding `tab-bar-format-menu-bar` at the beginning of the `tab-bar-format` value list.


## Theme

I worked really hard on my [modeline](./modeline.html) and I can reuse all that styling!
This is the snippet from my personal dusk theme<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>:

{% highlight elisp %}
;; modeline settings
'(mode-line ((t (:underline nil :overline nil :box (:line-width 8 :color "#353644" :style nil) :foreground "white" :background "#353644"))))
'(mode-line-buffer-id ((t (:weight bold))))
'(mode-line-emphasis ((t (:weight bold))))
'(mode-line-highlight ((((class color) (min-colors 88)) (:box (:line-width 2 :color "grey40" :style released-button))) (t (:inherit (highlight)))))
'(mode-line-inactive ((t (:weight light :underline nil :overline nil :box (:line-width 8 :color "#565063" :style nil) :foreground "white" :background "#565063" :inherit (mode-line)))))
;; tab bar settings
'(tab-bar ((t (:inherit mode-line))))
'(tab-bar-tab ((t (:inherit mode-line :foreground "white"))))
'(tab-bar-tab-inactive ((t (:inherit mode-line-inactive :foreground "black"))))
{% endhighlight %}


## Binding the Tab Hint Numbers

I have a pretty wonky keybinding setup, where I create my own minor mode key map and use that by default (as recommended by this [stackexchange post](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/352/how-to-override-major-mode-bindings/360#360)).
Here I use `(setq mac-command-modifier 'super)`.

The tab bar documentation indicates that to enable pressing `⌘-1` (or `s-1` as Emacs sees it) to switch to tab number 1 I would need:

{% highlight elisp %}
(setq tab-bar-select-tab-modifiers "super")
{% endhighlight %}

But this didn't work for me.
Instead, I bound each super-number combination (`s-1` through `s-0`) to `tab-bar-select-tab` and it works!


## Final Comments

As I mentioned above, the tab bar implementation is really nice.
This reflects the high standards that the Emacs community and developers have, especially for anything that becomes built in.
I was able to do all of this implementation and blogging while flying back from a semi-vacation in Greece (where I spent a lot of time improving my blog, if you didn't notice).
An editor with completely built-in documentation and an interface for configuring / customizing is really, really pleasant.
Not needing the internet to do something productive feels increasingly rare.


## Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Back when I wrote about [package cl being deprecated](./cl-deprecated.html), I noted that the way I define my theme was outdated.
I finally got around to modernizing it, but never wrote about the process.
I'm not sure a blog post would be useful, since I'm guessing most readers use existing theme packages.
I did start with the `customize-create-theme` function, which made the process of porting my old color-theme definition to the modern customize format trivial.

You can view my theme in my [dotfiles GitHub repo](https://github.com/gonsie/dotfiles/emacs/dusk-theme.el ).
