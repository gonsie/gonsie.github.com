# Notes From *How to Read a Book* by Mortimer J. Adler

## Part 1: The Activity of Reading

### Chapter 1: To the Average Reader

There is more to reading than what we learned in grade school. Have you ever read a book more than once and seen different things each time? That's some of real `reading`. This book will tell you how to get there. How to pull yourself up by your bootstraps to increase your understanding. 

> If we consider men and women generally, and apart from their professions or occupation, there is only one situation I can think of in which they almost pull themselves up by their bootstraps, making an effor to read better than they usually do. When they are in love and are reading a love letter, thery read for all they are worth. They read every word three ways; they read between the lines and in the margins; they read the whole in terms of ther parts, and each part in therms of the whole; they grow sensitive to context and ambiguity, to insinuation and implication; they perceive the color of words, the odor of phrases, and the weight of sentences. They may even take the punctuation into account. Then, if never before or after, they read.

### Chapter 2: The Reading of "Reading"

How do we define good readers? How do we create the scale to measure this?

There is active and what is called "passive" reading, but there really is no such thing. Reading is like communication... A baseball metaphor was presented:
- Pitcher and catcher work together. They have a similar understanding of what to expect and are on the same level. They are obviously 'active' but not extrodinarily
- Batter and outfielder must be very active. They do not know what to expect from the pitcher. 

From writer to reader is communication. One must be active about it.

### Chapter 3: Reading is Learning

Context: *Some* reading is learning. We assume that for this book.
Reading to aqurire knowledge... requires practice to improve skill in reading.

Reading for information vs. reading for understanding.
Example of college students who read for information and do not understand. Never connect the dots between information in one class to another or themselves.

> There books to be tasted, others to bo swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.
– Bacon

There is learing through discourse (reading and listening) and learning through discovery. 
Both require:
- keenness of obseravtion
- readily available memory
- range of imagination
- reason trained in analysis and reflection

Listening is learning from living teachers, reading is learning from dead ones.

### Chapter 4: Teachers, Dead or Alive

A live teacher can help with demonstration and correct technique. When it comes to discovery, they can only teach us the art of discovery. But, let's limit ourselves to live teachers as a source of knowledge, and therefore instruction.

Teachers and books usually compete or cooperate. Thus, you should be able to learn everything from just books. And if you seek understanding rather than information, books again win out. People may be somewhat passive readers, but they are most certainly passive listeners. For example, mindlessly taking notes in class. 

> Someone said you can tell the difference between graduate and undergraduate students in this way. If you walk into a classroom and say "Good morning," and the students reply, they are undergraduates. If they write it down, they are graduate students. 

__-3-__ Very interesting description of the role of teachers throughout the ages and `original communication`.

There are so many `great books` in that they are worth reading. And yet they are often unread. They can be read by anyone, but they do not spoon feed you. Instead they say:

> "Here is knowledge worth having. Come and get it."

Teachers should only see themselves as better students. And learn from the great "dead" teachers of history. They should not come between students and the material to learn.

The truely great books are worth it, and truely great in that they are the most readable. They reward reader for all the effort put forth. However little or much. 

> This book has only two functions to perform: to interest you in the profit of reading and to assist you in cultivating the art.

This book is full of hilarious quotes. Really though, it is hard to get across all the author is saying. He suggests that living teachers should do little more than demonstate how to be good students of the truely great men of history. And we should strive to learn all we can from their original communication.

> But you must admit in turn that the better the book, the more it is worth reading. Furthermore, if you learn how to read the great books, you will have no difficulty in reading other books, or for that matter anything else. You can use your skill to go after easier game. May I remind you, however, that the sportsman doesn't hunt lame ducks?

### Chapter 5: "The Defeat of the Schools"

Many people realize that the school system is failing students since they cannot speak and write (communicate) well. This has as much to do with reading as anything, although speaking and writing are obviously more 'active' activies than reading.

There is a mountain of evidence that students cannot read for understanding, and standardized tests only measure reading for information. It should not be too much to ask of our school system that students continue to learn to read well throughout high school and college.

Some people do have *disabilities*, but doctors cannot fix an *inability* to read. 

There are two reasons why students are not taught to read. First the school curriculums are too full and second the teachers do not seem to know how to teach reading. 

> The discipline that is identical with trained power is also identical with freedom... Genuine freedom, in short, is intellectual; it rests in the trained power of thought.
– John Dewey

While reading may be the most important in intellectual education, that does not mean that writing and communication don't come close behind. And in all things, a proper moral education should always be placed above an intellectual one. 

> Knowledge and skill are not the most important items in this life. Loving the right things is more important.

The (liberal) arts of grammar, logic, and rhetoric have been lost. The science of them is abound, but the actual artistic practice has almost disappeared.

There are two main reasons for the failure of our education system in teaching students to read. One is that scientific achievement as worshiped above all. This means facts and information, not understanding and the process. Second is that we think the past can teach us nothing. We are always looking forward to the new and as of yet undiscovered.

Even publishers would like more readers. They shouldn't have to dumb down the great books, just to get people to read.

Now, more than ever we have more people who can read, and more access to books. But, a much lower quality of reading. That isn't to say our society is doomed, but a drastic change is needed including a change in understanding the meaning 'docile', 'indoctirnated', and 'authority'.

> "Read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest."

### Chapter 6: On Self-Help

And thus it is obvious why the author wrote this book. He cannot see how the current system will improve itself, without outside influence.
