# Notes From *How to Read a Book* by Mortimer J. Adler

## Part 1: The Activity of Reading

### Chapter 1: To the Average Reader

There is more to reading than what we learned in grade school. Have you ever read a book more than once and seen different things each time? That's some of real `reading`. This book will tell you how to get there. How to pull yourself up by your bootstraps to increase your understanding. 

> If we consider men and women generally, and apart from their professions or occupation, there is only one situation I can think of in which they almost pull themselves up by their bootstraps, making an effort to read better than they usually do. When they are in love and are reading a love letter, they read for all they are worth. They read every word three ways; they read between the lines and in the margins; they read the whole in terms of ther parts, and each part in terms of the whole; they grow sensitive to context and ambiguity, to insinuation and implication; they perceive the color of words, the odor of phrases, and the weight of sentences. They may even take the punctuation into account. Then, if never before or after, they read.

### Chapter 2: The Reading of "Reading"

How do we define good readers? How do we create the scale to measure this?

There is active and what is called "passive" reading, but there really is no such thing. Reading is like communication... A baseball metaphor was presented:
- Pitcher and catcher work together. They have a similar understanding of what to expect and are on the same level. They are obviously 'active' but not extrodinarily
- Batter and outfielder must be very active. They do not know what to expect from the pitcher. 

From writer to reader is communication. One must be active about it.

### Chapter 3: Reading is Learning

Context: *Some* reading is learning. We assume that for this book.
Reading to aqurire knowledge... requires practice to improve skill in reading.

Reading for information vs. reading for understanding.
Example of college students who read for information and do not understand. Never connect the dots between information in one class to another or themselves.

> There books to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.
– Bacon

There is learing through discourse (reading and listening) and learning through discovery. 
Both require:
- keenness of obseravtion
- readily available memory
- range of imagination
- reason trained in analysis and reflection

Listening is learning from living teachers, reading is learning from dead ones.

### Chapter 4: Teachers, Dead or Alive

A live teacher can help with demonstration and correct technique. When it comes to discovery, they can only teach us the art of discovery. But, let's limit ourselves to live teachers as a source of knowledge, and therefore instruction.

Teachers and books usually compete or cooperate. Thus, you should be able to learn everything from just books. And if you seek understanding rather than information, books again win out. People may be somewhat passive readers, but they are most certainly passive listeners. For example, mindlessly taking notes in class. 

> Someone said you can tell the difference between graduate and undergraduate students in this way. If you walk into a classroom and say "Good morning," and the students reply, they are undergraduates. If they write it down, they are graduate students. 

__-3-__ Very interesting description of the role of teachers throughout the ages and `original communication`.

There are so many `great books` in that they are worth reading. And yet they are often unread. They can be read by anyone, but they do not spoon feed you. Instead they say:

> "Here is knowledge worth having. Come and get it."

Teachers should only see themselves as better students. And learn from the great "dead" teachers of history. They should not come between students and the material to learn.

The truely great books are worth it, and truely great in that they are the most readable. They reward reader for all the effort put forth. However little or much. 

> This book has only two functions to perform: to interest you in the profit of reading and to assist you in cultivating the art.

This book is full of hilarious quotes. Really though, it is hard to get across all the author is saying. He suggests that living teachers should do little more than demonstate how to be good students of the truely great men of history. And we should strive to learn all we can from their original communication.

> But you must admit in turn that the better the book, the more it is worth reading. Furthermore, if you learn how to read the great books, you will have no difficulty in reading other books, or for that matter anything else. You can use your skill to go after easier game. May I remind you, however, that the sportsman doesn't hunt lame ducks?

### Chapter 5: "The Defeat of the Schools"

Many people realize that the school system is failing students since they cannot speak and write (communicate) well. This has as much to do with reading as anything, although speaking and writing are obviously more 'active' activies than reading.

There is a mountain of evidence that students cannot read for understanding, and standardized tests only measure reading for information. It should not be too much to ask of our school system that students continue to learn to read well throughout high school and college.

Some people do have *disabilities*, but doctors cannot fix an *inability* to read. 

There are two reasons why students are not taught to read. First the school curriculums are too full and second the teachers do not seem to know how to teach reading. 

> The discipline that is identical with trained power is also identical with freedom... Genuine freedom, in short, is intellectual; it rests in the trained power of thought.
– John Dewey

While reading may be the most important in intellectual education, that does not mean that writing and communication don't come close behind. And in all things, a proper moral education should always be placed above an intellectual one. 

> Knowledge and skill are not the most important items in this life. Loving the right things is more important.

The (liberal) arts of grammar, logic, and rhetoric have been lost. The science of them is abound, but the actual artistic practice has almost disappeared.

There are two main reasons for the failure of our education system in teaching students to read. One is that scientific achievement as worshiped above all. This means facts and information, not understanding and the process. Second is that we think the past can teach us nothing. We are always looking forward to the new and as of yet undiscovered.

Even publishers would like more readers. They shouldn't have to dumb down the great books, just to get people to read.

Now, more than ever we have more people who can read, and more access to books. But, a much lower quality of reading. That isn't to say our society is doomed, but a drastic change is needed including a change in understanding the meaning 'docile', 'indoctirnated', and 'authority'.

> "Read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest."

### Chapter 6: On Self-Help

And thus it is obvious why the author wrote this book. He cannot see how the current system will improve itself, without outside influence.

It is also true that adult education is worth while, since there are no grades or tests or scores to keep adults learning. 

> Let me state now, simply and briefly, the conditions under which you can effectively hely yourself. Any art or skill is possessed by those who have formed the habit of operating according to its rules. In fact, the artist or craftsman in anf field differs thus from those who lack his skill. He has a habit they lack.

	See the movie "Jiro Dreams of Sushi", now on netflix

> In other words, to *understand* the rules is to *know more than* the rules.

So just follow the rules. And keep reading. You must continue to practice and improve your habits.

> The most direct sign that you have done the work of reading is *fatigue*.

Read with a pen and paper at your side, take notes of your thoughts.

> Intelligent note taking is probably as hard as intelligent reading.

Some examples of note taking (as representations in different steps in thinking):
- grasping the structure of the book => several outlines
- mark important words and sentences
- note shifts in meanings
- where the author appears to contradict himself

Example notes from the first couple chapters of this book:
	
>*Types of Reading:*
>	- I. For amusement
>	- II. For knowledge
>		- A. For information
>		- B. For understanding

>*Types of Learning:*
>	- I. By discovery: without teachers
>	- II. By instruction: thruough aid of teachers 
>		- A. By live teachers: lectures; listening
>		- B. By dead teachers: books; reading

>Hence *Reading II* (*A* and *B*) is *Learning II* (*B*)

>But books are also of different sorts:

>*Types of Books:*
>	- I. Digests and repetitions of other books
>	- II. Original communications

>And it appears that:

>	*Reading II (A)* is related more closely to *Books I*

>	*Reading II (B)* is related more closely to *Books II*


For the next part, the different sets of rules relate to different ways in which a book can be approached: 
1. as a complicatied structure of parts with unity in organization
2. in terms of linguistic elements
3. the relation of the author to the reader (similar to a conversation)

Other books about reading:
- *Interpretation in Teaching* by Mr. I. A. Richards: goes more into rules type 2, esp. principle of grammar and logic
- *Intelligent Reading* by Professor Tenney of Cornell: rules type 2 and 3

Some books on reading value semantics above all else, assuming that most books/authors are not worth reading, until proven otherwise. 
> We should assume that the author is intelligible until shown otherwise, not that he is guilty of nonsense and must prove his innocence.

## Part 2: The Rules

### Chapter 7: From Many Rules to One Habit

> While you are in the stage of learning to read, you have to go over a book more than once. If it is worth reading at all, it is worth three readings at least.

Meaning that there are three *ways* of reading, and an expert will be able to do all three readings at once. But start with threes individual focused readings.

This is based on scientific study of the learning process (detailed comparison of learning to type with learning to read). You start with many small, individual steps/rules, accelerate in skill, pleatu while working on larger chuncks, accelerate, plateau, accelerate, plateau, etc. The number of plateaus depends on the skill. Until all the small individual rules become one larger habit.

> At the beginning, the learner pays attention to himself and his skill in separate acts. When the acts have lost their separateness in the skill of the whole performance, the learner can at last pay attention to to goal which the technique he has acquired enables him to reach.

First you must *understand* the book, then you must *criticize* it. To understand a book, first you much approach in as a whole from the unity of the parts, then you must approach its elements and units of language and thought.

- Understand
	- I. The first reading can be called *structural* or analytic. Here the reader proceeds from the whole to its parts.
		1. what kind of book it is; subject matter
		2. what the book as a whole is trying to say;
		3. into what parts that whole is divided, and
		4. what the main problems are that the author is trying to solve
	- II. The second reading can be called *interpretative* or synthetic. Here the reader proceeds form the parts to the whole.
		1. You must discover and interpret the msot important *words* in the book;
		2. you must do the same or the most important *sentences*, and
		3. similarly for the *paragraphs* which express arguments
		4. you must know which of his problems the author solved, and which he failed on
- Criticize
	- III. The third reading can be called *critical* or evaluative. Here the reader judges the author, and decides whether he agrees or disagrees.

See [The Complete Rules](#the_rules) in chapter 14.

It is clear that the first two readings can be combined into one. They should be treated separately, but more or less be done side-by-side. The third reading must always come separately. One cannot and should not criticize, before truely understanding.

Intrinsic reading: reading a book in itself.
Extrinsic reading: reading a book in light of
	- dictionaries, encyclopedias almanacs
	- useful commentaries or digests
	- other great books
	- relevant experience 

Complications:
	- Reading two or more books in relation to each other
	- Reading a *whole* book
	- Reading to learn, and not reading for enjoyment. This also depends on the intent of the author. 
		- *fine* art: intent is to please and delight
		- *liberal* art: intent is to instruct by teaching the truth

This book only deals with scientific (not poetic) reading. For instructions on appreciating beauty, rather than truth, see page 135 (end of section 5).

> Beauty is truth, truth is beauty.

**False**. Don't event start to assume this is so. 


### Chapter 8: Catching on From the Title

First rule of the first reading:

> You must know what kind of (expository) book you are reading, and you should know this as early in the process as possible, preferably before you begin to read.

You can do this by looking at the front matter: title, subtitle, table of contents, preface, etc.

Ask the question: What kind of book is this? We need a scheme of classification.

- Practical: teach you *how* to do something which you think you *should*
- Theoretical: teach you *that* something *is* the case
    - History: Things or events in the past that changed over the course of time
	- Science: Timeless generalizations and universal physical truths. Relates to laboratory work.
	- Philosophy: Generalizations and objective truths. Relates to common, everyday life

Just as there are different topics to learn, there are different ways to learn them. Different subjects in school are taught differently, and learned differently, books on different subjects must be read differently. 


### Chapter 9: Seeing the Skeleton

Second and third rules pertain to the unity and organization of parts:

> State the unity of the whole book in a single sentence, or at most in several sentences (a short paragraph).

> Set forth the major parts of the book, and show how these are organized into a whole, by being ordered to one another and to the unity of the whole.

Rule 2: What is the *theme* or main *point*?

Rule 3: Although the previous rule gets at the bare bones, we must understand how the parts move and flow in the larger whole of the book.

This rule pertains to the major parts of the book in terms of their order and relation. The second rule was for *unity*, this one is for *complexity*. Each section of the whole has its own unity and complexity. A reader should make a rough approximation of these rules, and may choose to be more or less rigid with certain books.

> It is alright to hitch your wagon to a star, but you had better be sure it is well lubricated before you take the reins.

A master analyziz migth look something like:
- the statement of the major parts
- their division inot sections
- enumeration of poits in each section

Rule 4: Find out what the author's problems were.

A problem is a question. The book ostensibly contains one or more answers to it.

#### Questions anyone can ask about anything:
*Theoretical Questions*
- Does something exist?
- What kind of think is it?
- What caused it to exist, or under what conditions can it exist, or why does it exist?
- What purpose does it serve?
- What are the consequences of its existence?
- What are its characteristics properties, its typical traits?
- What are its relations to other things of a similar sort, or of a different sort?
- How does it behave?
*Practical Questions*
- What ends should be sought?
- What means should be chosen to a given end?
- What things must one do to gain a certain objective, and in what order?
- Under these conditions, what is the right thing to do, or the better rather than the worse?
- Under what conditions would it be better to do this rather than that?


### Chapter 10: Coming to Terms
### Chapter 11: What's the Proposition and Why
### Chapter 12: The Etiquette of Talking Back
### Chapter 13: The Things the Reader Can Say
### Chapter 14: And Still More Rules

<a id='the_rules'></a>
1. The Analysis of a Book's Structure
	1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.
	2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.
	3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and analyze these parts as you have analyzed the whole.
	4. Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve
2. The Interpretation of a Book's Contents
	1. Come to terms with the author by interpreting his basic words
	2. Grasp the author's leading propositions through dealing with his most important sentences.
	3. Know the author's arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences.
	4. Determine which of his problems the author solved, and which he did not; and of the latter, decide which the author knew he failed to solve.
3. The Criticism of a Book as a Communication of Konwledge
	1. General Maxims
		1. Do not begin criticism until you have completed analysis and interpretation. (Do not say you agree, disagree, or suspend judgement, until you can say, "I understand.")
		2. Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously.
		3. Respect the difference between knowledge and opinion, by having reasons for any critical judgement you make.
	2. Specific Criteria for Points of Criticism
		1. Show wherein the author in uninformed.
		2. Show wherein the author is misinformed.
		3. Show wherein the author is illogical.
		4. Show wherein the author's analysis or account is incomplete.
				
	Note: Of these, the first three are criteria for disagreement. Failing in all of these, you must argee, in part at least, though you may suspend judgement on the whole, in the light of the fourth point.
