title: "Signs the 'New Normal' has Returned"
---

At work we have an effort called the 'return to new normal' which is an admission that while we are returning to something that looks like pre-pandemic life, everything has changed and what is normal now is entitely different from before.

I (many others I know) are "exiting" the pandemic with new babies. If a global catatrophy doesn't change your whole life, a baby certainly will. Some things become more important (like having a job that supports your new reality) and some things less so (like whatever you thought your 5-year career plan should be).

As my baby exits her first year, I am finding myself returning to a new normal. My hobbies, reading and knitting, have restarted after a long lockdown and pregnancy pause. In an effort to [avoid storing my data in someone else's system](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=5397), I'll be adding some reading logs and knitting project posts here.
