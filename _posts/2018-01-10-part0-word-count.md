## An Excursion into E-Lisp and Org

I have had some recent success with learning Emacs lisp through Org-mode.
I've decided to write about for others looking to get started with elisp.

-   [Part 1: Using Org to Develop E-lisp Snippets]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-10-part1-org-for-dev-elisp %})
-   [Part 2: Counting Words]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-10-part2-counting-words %})

I plan to eventually write a third post describing the process of publishing a package.
