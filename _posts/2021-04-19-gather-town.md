It feels like time has officially moved forward and the unending month of March 2020 is over. All it took was attending this year's [ECP Annual Meeting](https://ecpannualmeeting.com), which corresponds to the last event I attended before lock down. Personally, I find doing anything for the first time to be a struggle... I guess it just took a whole "first" year of working from home to get over the hump.

This year, the ECP annual meeting is a virtual event. One of the platforms they are using is [Gather.Town](https://gather.town): a virtualized physical conference space. I. **love**. it.

You control a little avatar and move around a virtual space designed to look like work, or in this case, a meeting space. You enter rooms, you run into people, you get lost, someone corners you with a conversation that turns out to be awesome. I sit in the audience and work on my laptop while there is a talk going on in the background. Maybe it's the pandemic isolation getting to my head, but I miss this. I never thought moving a little virtual character could make me feel so present. The only thing missing here was a coffee station for people to gather around.

I am already scheduled to use Gather.Town for another event this summer (the [International HPC Summer School](https://ss21.ihpcss.org)). I canâ€™t wait to get my hands on helping to design the space. If we weren't virtual, the event would have been held in Toronto... maybe we can get a layout from some landmark there!

In the mean time, I think I'll try to create a personal Gather.Town instance... maybe I can convince a few of my more social co-workers (or even colleagues from other companies) to join me.
